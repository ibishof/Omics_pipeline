# Machine Learning Pipelines

**Clustering:**
Scripts for unsupervised clustering. Leveraging methods like k-means, hierarchical clustering, and graph-based approaches.

**Decision_Tree_Methods:**
These pipelines use either Random forest, Extra Treees, or XGboost to both select features and build models. The pipelines build a model (Random forest, Extra Trees, XGboost), calculates accuracy, feature importance, plots seperation via PCA, and recursively selects features. 

**Feature_reduction:**
These scripts use PCA or WGCNA outputs to reduce feature space

**Linear_Models:**
Elastic Net and other various linear models for classification and regression

**Other:**
Miscellaneous other modeling techniques

**Together these pipelines can move from raw data to final models**
